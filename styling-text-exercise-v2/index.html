      <h3>Park in our Heated Underground Garage!</h3>
      <p>Since our 1972 opening as a sister restaurant to the world-famous Hubabaloo’s Palace in New Orleans, DMIT Kitchens has evolved into the city’s premier destination for memorable dining served with true western hospitality. From the reservationist to the waiters, chefs and every associate behind the scenes, our team is focused on the highest standard of excellence and equally dedicated to creating enduring memories of snapshots in time: the sealing of business deals, wedding proposals, joyful celebrations, and the marking of significant milestones along life’s way. And the proof is in the (bread) pudding, with loyal patrons returning time and again to create new memories. Reflecting the same warmth as our friendly greeting, each farewell concludes with our restaurent's signature lagniappe: an abundance of unforgettably fresh saskatoon berries. </p>

        <h3>Our Fine Menu</h3>
        <p>Dishes are passionately prepared and meticulously plated each day for hundreds of lunch and dinner guests with varying needs, interests, and backgrounds: coat-and-tie business professionals, well-heeled ladies that lunch, world dignitaries, special occasion diners, and patrons of the city’s arts. Not to imply that we’re a hot spot for jet setters (although many of our patrons have jets, and some have setters as well), our dining rooms are also filled with plenty of regular folks that just love DMIT Kitchens great food and a quiet atmosphere with a well stocked bar.</p>

From our welcoming greeting, throughout dining, to the Bananas Foster, and finally a fond farewell, we create a unique environment that sets the perfect backdrop for great memories to come to life.
